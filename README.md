# Meteoink
This branch contains deprecated variant of meteostation for machines withou SPI-RAM.
Software here is somehow working, but there is no development anymore due to big amount
of issues related to memory and fragmentation. This required good strategy of using of
components (ideally large components loaded as first) and some tweaking aroung garbage
collector. Finding a way how to make it runnig on the edge is really time consuming.
Therefore I stopped development here and moved on processors with SPI-RAM.
